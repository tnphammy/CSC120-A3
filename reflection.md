Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Sofia and Meron.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Sunday, 15 February, 1-3 PM.
    
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    * It's a great method of communication. Stating the type of data before the data itself is not that hard, yet helpful.
    * I found creating arrays a bit lengthy and overly procedural.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    * OOP is very nice for a multitude of things, but not the best approach for everything. It is very similar to real life things.
    * Between Java and Python, I would reach for Python for most projects if I had to go in blind due to its versatility and intuitive syntax (at least for me). However, for projects that I know could really benefit from the OOP approach, I would 100% reach for Java as its more dedicated and thus truly functional for this one purpose.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    * What worked:
        - Resting! I had problems with the mirroring and some nextLine() troubles and I gave up for the night. Once I got into TA hours and started understanding the core concepts, I was slowly able to figure things out that were blatantly obvious.
        - Explaining my procedures to ChatGPT. I explicitly asked for it NOT to give me answers (as I knew I didn't trust its answers that much to begin with), but whenever I was stuck, I would give it my code, tell it what was going wrong, and my suspicions of what might be that culprit. I would continue to conversate with it a bit and speculate and make adjustments to my code until I finally resolved the issue. It re-explained to me some core concepts like nextInt(), nextLine(), split(), and so I could reason to it what I thought was happening. It would also help me code trace and theorize what was going on in my program. 

    * What didn't:
        - Stubbornly sitting there. Besides from that, the rest was fine.

    * Advice:
        - Make sure you grasp the functions you are using.
        - Practice code tracing, in your head and on paper.
        - Hear people's input (TAs, Profs, or your friends)!
